  	   <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>A first-year student at ESSEC Business School pursuing a Global BBA degree and later aiming to specialize in marketing, entrepreneurship, or a combination of both. I take delight in learning about different cultures of different regions and am passionate about my love for food and music. My goal is to find a job I love and grab all the opportunities I encounter. I am humbled by my culture, and now that I spread my wings out in the world, I would like to continue my journey by learning from my surroundings and becoming a global citizen of tomorrow.

     	<h2>Food</h2>
     	<p>I love to cook. Food has always been a big part of my life. I always take inspiration from recipies and add my love to make it my own. I am also a very determined foodie and after coming to France i have expanded my palate and am open to try different traditional dishes. After Indian cuisine. I have fallen in love with Japanese food,like, Ramen, Gyoza, Tori Shoyo and what not.

    	<div id="Music" class="card-white">
     	<h2>Music</h2>
     	<p>Surprisingly, I was first a dancer and was really bad at singing but slowly after practicing one song with my friends on and on, I enhanced my vocal skills and took it as an opportunity to start singing all kinds of songs. However, I feel that sad songs best suit my voice, though a few people disagree as I have a flair when I sing Indian folk songs. Being at ESSEC is definitely not easy and very competitive, and to overcome that a friend of mine suggested to take small breaks by playing the Ukelele. Given that I already had a previous understanding of stringed instruments, it was very easy and now I sing and play ukukele at the same time and it just flows. I am not picky on what music I listen to, it just has to match the vibe!

    	<div id="TV Series" class="card-white">
      	<h2>TV Series</h2>
      	<p>I love watching Anime (Japanese Cartoons, It is much more than that but still just for clarity). Anime is somenthing where I am not only learning Japanese culture but also a few japanese phrases and am fascinated by Japanese culture. Netflix is a huge platform where I learn different cultures, I have watched series of different languages, which gives me an understanding of the language and of the culture. Who said Netflix isn't a teacher!
